## Comments

Challenges:
- Scrapping, use Cheerio, analyze several webs to find the best way to get good info
- Realize that you are scrapping top to down the HTML, I needed to find a way for move from FIFO to LIFO to update the MongoDB, sound easy but it is not
- It was mandatory to use Node, Express, Handlebars, Cheerio, Express-handlebar, MongoDB, Mongoose, Body-parser, Cheerio, Request. Sometimes Handlebar can be complicated if you are having to many async functions playing around.
